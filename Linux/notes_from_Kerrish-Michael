Linux notes from Kerrisk-Michael:

    2.1 Fundamental concepts:
        The kernel:
            also know as the operating system
            It provides a software layer to manage the limited resources of a computer.
            The Linux kernel executable resides at the pathname /boot/vmlinuz
            Tasks performed by the kernel:
                Process Scheduling
                Memory management
                Provision of a file system
                Creation and termination of processes
                Access to devices
                Networking
                Provision of a system call application programming interface [API]
            Kernel mode and User mode:
                When running in user mode, the CPU can access only the memory that is marked as being in user space, however, it can't access memory in the kernel space
                When running in kernel mode, CPU can access botht he user and kernel memory space
                Operations such as executing halt instruction to stop system, accessing memory management hardware, initiating device I/O operation, can only be done in kernel mode.
    2.2 The Shell:
    2.3 Users and Groups:
    2.4 Single Directory Hierarchy, Directories, Links, and Files
    2.5 File I/O Model:
    2.6 Programs:
        Command-line arguments:
            int main(int argc, char *argv[])
            -> The argc variable contains the total number of command-line arguments, and the
            individual arguments are available as strings pointed to by members of the array
            argv. The first of these strings, argv[0], identifies the name of the program itself
