Roadmap:

Starting plan:
	1. Understand the Basics of Networking and Security

	Networking Concepts: Learn about TCP/IP, subnets, firewalls, and protocols (HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).
	Security Fundamentals: Familiarize yourself with concepts such as encryption, authentication, and common vulnerabilities (like OWASP Top Ten).
	
	2. Learn About Operating Systems
	
	Linux: Get comfortable with Linux, as many hacking tools and servers run on it. Start with a distribution like Ubuntu or Kali Linux.
	Windows: Understand Windows internals, as many targets are Windows-based.
	
	3. Programming and Scripting Skills
	
	Python: It's widely used in hacking for scripting and automation. Learn how to write scripts to automate tasks.
	JavaScript: Useful for web application hacking and understanding client-side vulnerabilities.
	
	4. Familiarize Yourself with Hacking Tools
	
	Kali Linux: A distribution specifically designed for penetration testing with pre-installed tools (like Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite).
	Wireshark: For network analysis and packet sniffing.
	Burp Suite: For web application security testing.
	
	5. Hands-On Practice
	
	Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions: Join platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or OverTheWire to practice your skills in a controlled environment.
	Vulnerable Applications: Use intentionally vulnerable applications like DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) or OWASP Juice Shop to practice exploiting vulnerabilities.
	
	6. Learn Ethical Hacking
	
	Courses: Consider taking online courses or certifications like Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).
	Books: Read books like "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson or "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto.
	
	7. Stay Updated and Join Communities
	
	Forums and Communities: Engage with forums like Redditâ€™s r/hacking, Stack Overflow, or specialized Discord servers.
	Follow Blogs and Podcasts: Stay current by following cybersecurity blogs and podcasts.
	
	8. Ethical Considerations
	
	Always practice hacking ethically. Ensure you have permission before testing systems and adhere to the laws and regulations in your area.
	Conclusion
